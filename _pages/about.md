* I am going to join the AI foundation team in LinkedIn as a machine learning and relevance engineering in June.
* I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Xia (Ben) Hu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html) in 2021. 
* Before joining TAMU, I received my B.S. degree in Statistics at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn) in 2016. 
* My research interests lie in the general area of data mining and machine learning, particularly in automated machine learning, tensor analysis, and their applications in recommender systems and social networks.
